==========================================================================

• If a MAME game that you like is missing from the main list, it may have
  been filtered out. Run mame_list_tool.exe and click on the "View Filtered
  Games" button. Search for the rom/game in the list, and you should find
  the reason it was excluded at the end of the line. Next, press the "Edit 
  Game List Filters" and either change the filter that excluded the game or
  add the rom to the exception list in the [Rom_Exceptions] section. Finally,
  save the file and press the "Start" button to re-build the game list.

• If a game fails to run from inside arcadeEIP, exit arcadeEIP and then
  try double-clicking on runlast_native.bat. This will attempt to run the
  most recent game that arcadeEIP attempted to run in a command console 
  window. This will often provide more information about why it failed.

• If arcadeEIP crashes, it could cause the taskbar and/or mouse pointer to
  remain hidden. If this happens, and you are able, run fix.bat (or eip -fix) 
  to restore the pointer and taskbar.

• If attempting to run a MAME game in an RDP (remote desktop) session, it
  may fail. To resolve, try running arcadeEIP using the -video gdi parameter.

   >eip.exe -video gdi 

• If you use port audio in MAME, arcadeEIP may produce no sound when MAME
  games are running. To you desire to resolve this, see sound.txt.

Sound
=====
arcadeEIP supports sound effects via the bass.dll library.

To enable sound, you must download the third party bass.dll library file and place it in the
root folder of arcadeEIP.  You may obtain this file from:

https://www.un4seen.com/

To install, download the Win32 version: base24.zip.  For 64-bit versions of Windows, extract
bass.dll from the \x64 folder of the archive (note that I have not tested the 32-bit version 
in the root folder and have no idea whether it will work).

Once this file is installed, sound should be enabled automatically.

NOTE REGARDING MAME PORT AUDIO
==============================
If you use port audio with MAME (very highly recommended since it dramatically reduces audio
latency), sound effects in arcadeEIP *will not* ordinarily work while MAME is running since 
port audio takes exclusive control over the soundcard, and arcadeEIP is designed to overlay
the running emulator. To work around this and enable sound effects in arcadeEIP's overlay menus
while port-audio MAME is running, a second sound card and audio combiner/mixer is required.  

Here is one way to set this up:

Prerequisties
=============
A. A second audio card.  In my case, my default card is a Soundblaster Audigy FX (speakers are 
connected to this one) and the secondary "card" to be used by arcadeEIP is the Realtek audio 
built into my motherboard.

B. A hardware audio mixer. I use the inexpensive "Maker hart Just Mixer S", sold on Amazon.

Note that if you are more audio inclined than I, you might know of ways to make this work with 
software mixers; however, my experimentation with that resulted in the latency benefits of port 
audio being lost, making the effort pointless.

Instructions
============
1. Keep the pa_device setting in MAME's port audio options set to default. In this way, MAME will
use your main, default audio card (i.e. the one your speakers are connected to).

   #
   # PORTAUDIO OPTIONS
   #
   pa_api                    "Windows WASAPI"
   pa_device                 default
   pa_latency                0.003334

2.  At a command line prompt in your arcadeEIP folder, run 

    >util.exe -sound

This will list all your audio devices. Identify the number associated with your *secondary* audio card.
For example, when I ran this, I found that my secondary (Realtek) card was device 6.

    6: Speakers (2- Realtek High Definition Audio)

3.  In the [General] section of arcadeEIP.ini, set sound_device to the device number of this secondary
card.  For example, because my secondary card was device 6, I specified:

    [General]
    sound_device=6

4.  Next, plug the speaker outputs of both sound cards into the inputs of the hardware mixer, and plug
your speakers into the hardware mixer's output.

At this point, you should be able to test and hear sound from both sources. 

5.  Spend some time calibrating the volume. Here are some tips.  If using the mixer from Amazon referenced
above, set the master volume to maximum and the line inputs to about the 9:00 position to start (setting the 
master level high and the line levels relatively low results in the least noise). Also be sure to use a "clean"
electrical source and keep away from things like fans and power supplies as this mixer is susceptible to 
electrical noise, but does run quiet if care is taken.

Next, set the volume in Windows for both devices to 50% and play the Windows test sample sounds. As you switch
between the two devices in Windows, these sounds should (a) be the same volume and (b) be at a loudness that
is the loudest you would ever use in practice (reference volume). If either of these is not as described, then 
adjust the individual input dials (not the master) to fix it.  As a final check, you may want to turn the volume
in Windows up to 100% and re-play the test samples. In this case you are listening for any distortion. If you 
hear such distortion, turn down the individual input dials just enough to eliminate it. Finish up by going back
to 50% volume and confirming that the volume of both devices still sounds the same. 

6.  Finally, if you use digital volume adjustment on your arcade machine and don't want to have to adjust the
volumes of both cards separately when making day-to-day volume changes, you can set sync_volume=1 in the 
[General] section of arcadeEIP.ini.  

    [General]
    sync_volume=1

When you do this, arcadeEIP will automatically try to set the secondary card's volume to the same value as
the default device whenever its volume is changed.

MAME quick start guide
=======================================================================
To install, unzip arcadeEIP to a dedicated folder (e.g. C:\arcadeEIP). 

These instructions assume MAME 172+ is installed and that it is pre-tested
to work and has its roms located in the MAME \rom folder 

***Versions of MAME prior to 172 lack of the -keyboardprovider dinput parameter
used by arcadeEIP, and are, therefore, not recommended***

It is also highly recommended that you use a no-nag build of MAME in order
to have the most polished experience. If you do not wish to build your own no-nag
executable or do not know how, you should be able to find one here:

https://forums.launchbox-app.com/files/file/3270-mame-no-nag-updated-monthly-current-version/

Finally, it is highly recommended that you use the default parameters provided in
arcadeEIP.ini for MAME; especially the following ones, which will provide maximum 
compatibility with arcadeEIPs intended usage.

-skip_gameinfo -autosave -keyboardprovider dinput

See video here for a walk-through of these instructions:

(note that this video pre-dates this release and is no longer completely synchronized
with these instructions).

*** By default, tap the period key (.) to exit game/arcadeEIP      ***
*** Use RIGHT ctrl-alt-k to force-exit arcadeEIP if it ever hangs. ***
=======================================================================

1. Double-click create_cfg.bat to create default arcadeEIP.ini and
   arcadeEIP_example.ini files.
   
2. Load arcadeEIP.ini into a text editor like notepad or preferably, 
   notepad++ (which will show syntax highlighting).

3. In the [System_mame] section of arcadeEIP.ini, edit exe_full_path= 
   to match your system (tip: don't remove the ",min" option at the end).

4. If your roms are located somewhere other than mame's \rom folder,
   also edit search_path= to match the actual location of your roms. 

5. In the [General] section, set seed_rom= to any favorite rom you 
   know you have.

6. Optional: If you're feeling brave, set hide_cursor=1 and hide_taskbar=1
   in the [Front_End_os] section. However, it is recommended to only set 
   these to 1 after you have confirmed least one successful startup. After
   that, settings these to 1 becomes highly recommended.

Now...save arcadeEIP.ini, then double-click on eip.exe to run your seed game...

Or at a command prompt run:

   >eip mame galaga
   
...to run a specific game (partial names ok).

While in any game:
==================
A. Press the tilde key (~) to exit (or hold period key for 2+ seconds).
B. Press comma (,) to pause.  While in pause, use left/right arrow
   keys or joystick to page through configured info and graphic screens.
C. Tap the period key (.) or apostrophe (') key to toggle the game selection 
   screen on/off:
D. Navigate using the arrow keys or joystick (mouse/trackball/spinner support
   may be turned on in the .ini file).
E. Select a new game to play using the LCtrl key.
F. Use "m" key to mark a game as a favorite or "s" to change star rating
G. Use "Enter" to add a game to the "Picks" list for the system, "v" to
   view that list, and "Enter" while in the "Picks" list to remove a game.
H. See readme.txt and docs for many more commands and functions.

Managing Game Lists:
====================
Use the "Picks" view (step G. above) or create custom lists to make game 
lists exactly to your liking. To filter the master game list for MAME, run
mame_list_tool.exe. If you'd like make your lists cleaner by removing text
in parenthesis, see the clean_lists option in the Configuration Reference Guide.
For example, adding clean_list=1 (the default) to the [System_mame] section of 
arcadeEIP.ini will "clean" the text in the "Picks" view while leaving the text 
in the main list unaffected. Setting clean_lists=2 will do the same for both views.

Autoswitching:
==============
By default, as you play games, the autoswitch list will auto-populate with
those games. If you walk away with a game still in session, the active game will
switch every 5 minutes. This is like a screensaver, but the games will be playable.
By default the list holds the 20 most played games. You may also manage this list
and its timings manually.

Updating Graphics Files
=======================
arcadeEIP comes with a starter set of logo and marquee files. These are named
after the roms and located in the \Assets\MAME\Logos\Rom and \Assets\MAME\Marquees\Rom
folders respectively. You may add to these or update them as you please. If you don't
know where to obtain such files, consider a tool such as "EmuMovies Sync" found at:

https://emumovies.com/files/file/321-emumovies-sync/

You may also, alternatively, use LaunchBox as a source of your graphics files and
game metadate instead on a global or system-by-system basis (see next section).

Using LaunchBox as a Content Manager/Scraper
============================================
If you use LaunchBox, you may use it as your content manager/scraper instead of 
using arcadeEIP's graphic files and metadata. To do this, just add the following 
lines (with paths adjusted to your machine) to the [System_mame] section.  In this 
case, we assume that the name of the LaunchBox platform for MAME is "Arcade".

    logo_folder=D:\LaunchBox\Images\Arcade\Clear Logo
    marquee_folder=D:\LaunchBox\Images\Arcade\Arcade - Marquee
    system_logo=D:\LaunchBox\Images\Platforms\Arcade\Clear Logo\Arcade.png

When you do this, your game list in arcadeEIP should automatically synchronize 
with the one you have in LaunchBox. See the file LaunchBox.txt in the ".\Docs\
[Front_End] examples" folder for more information about integration with LaunchBox.

Naturally, all this is customizable.  See the full docs for much more.

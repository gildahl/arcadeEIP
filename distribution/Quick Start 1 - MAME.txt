MAME quick start guide
=======================================================================
Unzip arcadeEIP to a dedicated folder (e.g. C:\arcadeEIP).
Assumes MAME 172+ is installed with roms in the MAME's \rom folder.
Works best with a no-nag build of MAME (but not strictly required).

See video here for a walk-through of these instructions:

*** By default, tap the period key (.) to exit a game.             ***
*** Use right ctrl-alt-k to force-exit arcadeEIP if it ever hangs. ***
=======================================================================

1. Double-click create_cfg.bat to create arcadeEIP.ini and
   arcadeEIP_example.ini
   
2. Load arcadeEIP.ini into a text editor like notepad or (preferably), 
   notepad++.

3. In the [System_mame] section of arcadeEIP.ini, edit exe_full_path= 
   to match your system (don't remove the ",min" option at the end).

4. If your roms are located somewhere other than mame's \rom folder,
   also edit the search_path= to match the actual location of your roms 

5. In the [General] section, set seed_rom= to any favorite rom you 
   know you have.

6. If you'd like to hide the mouse cursor during gameplay, set hide_cursor=1
   in the [Front_End_os] section.

6a. Optional: If you have them, copy a set of game logo files (named
    after your roms) into ..\Assets\MAME\Logos\Rom
    (or set logo_folder= in [Global_Assets] to where they are.)

6b. Optional: Instead of following step 6a, if you use LaunchBox, you may use
    it as your content manager instead.  Just add the following lines (with 
    paths adjusted to your machine) to the [System_mame] section.  In this 
    case, we assume that the name of the LaunchBox platform for MAME is "Arcade".

    logo_folder=D:\LaunchBox\Images\Arcade\Clear Logo
    marquee_folder=D:\LaunchBox\Images\Arcade\Arcade - Marquee
    system_logo=D:\LaunchBox\Images\Platforms\Arcade\Clear Logo\Arcade.png

    (see the file LaunchBox.txt in the "Docs\[Front_End] examples" folder
     for more information about integration with LaunchBox)

Now...just double-click on eip.exe to run your seed game...

Or at a command prompt run:

   >eip mame galaga
   
...to run a specific game (partial names ok).

While in any game:

1. Press the period key (.) to exit.
2. Press comma (,) to pause.  While in pause, use left/right arrow
   keys or joystick to page through controls and info screens.
3. Press apostrophe (') or hold the period key (.) for 2+ sec to toggle the
   game selection menu on/off:
4. Navigate using the arrow keys or joystick.
5. Select a new game to play using the LCtrl key.
6. Use "M" key to mark a game as a favorite or "S" to change star rating
7. Use Space to add a game to the "Picks" list for the system and "LAlt" to
   view that list.
8. See docs for many more functions.

Autoswitching:
By default, as you play games, the autoswitch list will auto-populate with
those games. If you walk away with a game still in session, the active game will
switch every 3 minutes. This is like a screensaver, but the games will be playable.
By default the list holds the 20 most played games.

Naturally, all this is customizable.  See the full docs for much more.

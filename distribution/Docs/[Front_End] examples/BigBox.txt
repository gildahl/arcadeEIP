Integration with BigBox
=======================

Here are the steps to integrate:

1. Add an appropriately tagged [Front_End] section to your arcadeEIP.ini file under
   the existing [Front_End_os] section.

[Front_End_bigbox]  <-- append section name with same value as the fe_key
fe_key=bigbox
proper_name=BigBox
asset_name=BigBox
window_name=LaunchBox Big Box
exe_full_path=D:\LaunchBox\BigBox.exe
start_screen=1
exit_screen=1
hide_cursor=1
hide_taskbar=0
run_apps=ultramap,winipac  <-- see note
show_on_pause=
kiosk_mode=0

* Note: This example includes a run_apps= line that specifies that ultramap and 
  winipac (two control panel configuration tools), that should be called on each 
  return to BigBox. You may or may not need something like this depending on your 
  machine.  See the documentation for more about control panel configuration.

1. Within LaunchBox tools, you can setup a single emulator in LaunchBox/BigBox capable
   of supporting all arcadeEIP systems.  To do this, see the document LaunchBox.txt
   for instructions.  This file may be found in the "\Docs\[Front_End] examples" folder.
   
2. Preferably, launch BigBox, using the command-line/shortcut,
 
     >eip bigbox
   
   This will ensure the options in your [Front_End_bigbox] section are active.

Compatibility Notes
===================
A. The arcadeEIP game menu may not operate correctly when used when BigBox's Loading Game
message option is turned on. Since arcadeEIP already implements bookend screens, it is
recommended that you turn off the BigBox option and use arcadeEIP's loading screens 
instead. This can be done by going into BigBox's Option menu, and then in the Game 
Startup option, uncheck Show "Loading Game..." , Message

B. If BigBox does not regain focus after returning from a game, check that the window_name
option in the [Front_End_bigbox] section of arcadeEIP.ini is set to "LaunchBox Big Box" as
shown above in the sample.

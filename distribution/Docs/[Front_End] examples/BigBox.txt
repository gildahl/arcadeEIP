Integration with BigBox
=======================

Here are the steps to integrate:

1. Add an appropriately tagged [Front_End] section to your arcadeEIP.ini file under
   the existing [Front_End_os] section.

[Front_End_bigbox]  <-- append section name with same value as the fe_key
fe_key=bigbox
proper_name=BigBox
asset_name=BigBox
exe_full_path=D:\LaunchBox\BigBox.exe
start_screen=1
exit_screen=1
hide_cursor=1
run_apps=ultramap,winipac  <-- see note

* Note: This example includes a run_apps= line that specifies that ultramap and 
  winipac (two control panel configuration tools), that should be called on each 
  return to BigBox. You may or may not need something like this depending on your 
  machine.  See the documentation for more about control panel configuration.

1. Within LaunchBox tools, you can setup a single emulator in LaunchBox/BigBox capable
   of supporting all arcadeEIP systems.  To do this, see the document LaunchBox.txt
   for instructions.  This file may be found in the "\Docs\[Front_End] examples" folder.
   
2. Preferably, launch BigBox, using the command-line/shortcut,
 
     >eip bigbox
   
   This will ensure the options in your [Front_End_bigbox] section are active.

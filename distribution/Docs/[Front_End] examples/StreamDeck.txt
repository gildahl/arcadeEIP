Elgato Stream Deck Integration Tips
===================================

The Elgato Stream Deck is a programmable button appliance that can take advantage of 
arcadeEIP's direct launch and hotkey functions to craft a button-based interface that can
control most of arcadeEIP's features.  You will not need to setup a [Front_End] section in
arcadeEIP.ini for the Stream Deck, and it will work seamlessly with arcadeEIP in both its
standalone mode or when integrated with another front-end like BigBox or GameEx.

This guide assumes you know how to program an Elgato Stream Deck profile and just provides 
guidance on a few things that are specific to arcadeEIP when using it with the Stream Deck. 

Prerequisties
==========================================================================================
* Successfully complete the MAME Quick Start guide (or otherwise already up-and-running).
* Back-up arcadeEIP.ini before starting.
* Read the readme.txt file in the \Direct folder (to understand hotstring files).
* Download and install the free "SuperMacro By BarRaider" Plug-In from Stream Deck store.
==========================================================================================

1. To configure a button on the Stream Deck to launch a game:

  A. First, make sure that there is a hotstring type direct-switch file for the game present 
     in arcadeEIP's \Direct folder. For this quick start guide, we will use the example
     file: "@!@mame_zaxxon.txt", which should already be in that folder by default.

  B. Configure a button in the Stream Deck by drag/dropping a "Super Macro" action on it.
     Specify the following macro text in the "Short Press" window.

     {{MOUSEX200:200,Y}}{{LBUTTON}}{{pause:300}}@!@mame_zaxxon{{enter}}

     **Important** if you are configuring a Multi-Action button on your Stream Deck that will
     fire this macro and also change the profile (for example, to switch to a custom profile 
     with buttons specific to the game), make sure the Macro function is listed as the first
     mulit-action function.

  C. Run eip.exe, and test the button.

2. To configure a button to toggle arcadeEIP's game picker menu on/off, drag/drop a "Hotkey" 
   control onto your button and specify the hotkey as "'" (or whatever value menu_toggle_key
   is set to in the [Key_Map] section of arcadeEIP.ini).

3. Note that you can't assign a magic_key exit button to a Stream Deck button (default ".").
   So if you want to be able to use a hotkey button in your Stream Deck to exit arcadeEIP 
   while retaining magic_key functionality for your control panel, use the quit_key (default "~")
   in the Stream Deck instead.
   

So in general, you will use the hotstring method above in step 1 to launch games, and you will
use Stream Deck Hotkeys to program buttons to send keystrokes to arcadeEIP or to games. Beyond
this, the Stream Deck offers quite a bit of flexibility to customize your profiles in many other
ways that are beyond the scope of this short tutorial.

=================================================================================================
As a final note, be aware that at present, Stream Deck hotkey actions do not trip arcadeEIP's 
internal hardware input monitor which is designed to prevent games from automatically switching 
while playing a game.  This won't be a problem as long as your game also uses ordinary control
panel input; however, if your game uses mostly (or exclusively) input through the Stream Deck
you may experience game-switching while a game is in progress.  I'll be looking at this at
some point, but it should be rather rare. If you do experience this, it is recommended to try
making your autoswitch delay longer and/or assigning one or more regularly used button presses
to a control panel button instead.

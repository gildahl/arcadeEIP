Integrating with LaunchBox
==========================

*********************************************************************************
IMPORTANT: Before integrating with LaunchBox, make sure arcadeEIP is fully 
configured, tested, and working outside of LaunchBox for every system that you 
will use it with first.
**********************************************************************************

arcadeEIP doesn't have any built-in capability for downloading images or any UI 
support for curating rom collections and their metadata.  However, arcadeEIP does 
integrate nicely and quite easily with LaunchBox (which does these things very
well), making it simple to use that product as a content manager for arcadeEIP.
in fact, you could regard arcadeEIP as being as a kind of "loose" plug-in for that
product.

At the most basic level, if you already have LaunchBox and want arcadeEIP to use 
LB's media files and metadata for a particular platform in arcadeEIP, you may just 
add these lines to the appropriate (and already configured/working) [System] section
in arcadeEIP.ini (with the paths adjusted to your machine, of course), to have 
arcadeEIP begin to use LB's assets.

    logo_folder=D:\LaunchBox\Images\Arcade\Clear Logo
    marquee_folder=D:\LaunchBox\Images\Arcade\Arcade - Marquee
    system_logo=D:\LaunchBox\Images\Platforms\Arcade\Clear Logo\Arcade.png

From these paths, arcadeEIP will not only be able to use LB's images, but it will
also be able to find the metadata for these games, so that the game list in arcadeEIP
will be synchronized with LaunchBox and data such as publisher, developer, year, 
genre, etc., will be visible in arcadeEIP's menu screen. 

Note that star ratings and favorites from LaunchBox are not synchronized with arcadeEIP
since arcadeEIP maintains its own independent database to store and manage that 
information.

Configuring arcadeEIP as a launcher within LaunchBox
====================================================
arcadeEIP does NOT use LaunchBox's emulator/launch configurations.  Therefore, you
must still setup your emulators in arcadeEIP.ini.  However, once you have done this
arcadeEIP CAN be (optionally) be used as a launcher within LaunchBox. This is the 
preferred way to set things up if you are an arcadeEIP user, but is not strictly
required.

See the first part of my BigBox video at https://youtu.be/dLsFjxceT0I to see how
this can be done. You may also follow the instructions shown here:

Within LaunchBox tools, you can setup a single emulator in LaunchBox capable of 
supporting all arcadeEIP systems.  To do this, create an "Emulator" having these 
properties:
   
   * Emulator Name: ArcadeEIP
   * Application Path: ..\arcadeEIP\eip.exe (i.e select from wherever you put it).
   * Leave Default Command-Line Parameters empty
   * Check only the option to "Remove file extension and folder path"
     (This is not mandatory, but recommended so that if you move rom files in the 
     future, you don't have to also move them in LaunchBox's configuration).

   Then, under "Associated Platforms", create a Platform for each arcadeEIP System you 
   want to run under LaunchBox. In each, specify the sys_key from arcadeEIP.ini as the
   Default Command-Line parameter.  

   Finally, import roms into each of these platforms using arcadeEIP as the emulator,
   and each configured platform as the Platform. 

   As mentioned above, if you wish to use LaunchBox's managed image assets (logos and 
   marquees), then add marquee_folder, logo_folder, and system_logo settings to each 
   System that will use these assets, for example, if you would like your MAME system
   to use the LaunchBox Arcade assets, set these values to appropriate paths within
   [System_mame].  For example,

       [System_mame]
       sys_key=mame
       ...
       marquee_folder=D:\LaunchBox\Images\Arcade\Arcade - Marquee
       logo_folder=D:\LaunchBox\Images\Arcade\Clear Logo 
       system_logo=D:\LaunchBox\Images\Platforms\Arcade\Clear Logo\Arcade.png

    If your asset_name is configured to use the platform names used by LaunchBox, you
    may use the [asset_name] tag to make this configuration easier. For example, 

       [System_mame]
       sys_key=mame
       asset_name=Arcade
       ...
       marquee_folder=D:\LaunchBox\Images\[asset_name]\Arcade - Marquee
       logo_folder=D:\LaunchBox\Images\[asset_name]\Clear Logo 
       system_logo=D:\LaunchBox\Images\Platforms\[asset_name]\Clear Logo\Arcade.png

    And, of course, if all of your systems will be using the LB assets, you could just
    specify something like this in [Global_Assets] rather than adding to each section.
    Experiment to see what works best for you.

       [Global_Assets]
       ...
       marquee_folder=D:\LaunchBox\Images\[global_asset_name]\Arcade - Marquee
       logo_folder=D:\LaunchBox\Images\[global_asset_name]\Clear Logo 
       system_logo=D:\LaunchBox\Images\Platforms\[global_asset_name]\Clear Logo\Arcade.png

    Note that there is no need to create .meta files when using LaunchBox since arcadeEIP
    creates them virtually using information pulled directly from LB's configuration files. 

Integration with BigBox
=======================
arcadeEIP may be used with LaunchBox as either an alternative to BigBox, or as a supplement
to BigBox.  If you have setup arcadeEIP as a launcher inside of LaunchBox and want to also
integrate BigBox, then view the second part of https://youtu.be/dLsFjxceT0I, and also see
the file BigBox.txt in the "\Docs\[Front_End]examples" folder for written instructions.

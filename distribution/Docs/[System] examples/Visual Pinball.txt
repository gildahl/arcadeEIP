Note: Use of window_name (such as window_name=Visual Pinball Player) is not recommended for 
      Visual Pinball if you use tables in which the VPinMAME DMD overlays the table. 

Note: This example shows how two different versions of Visual Pinball can be combined.
      VPX works a bit different than VP9 (different file extensions, different executable,
      for example).  However, because it is preferrable to have all tables in one "system",
      the above example achieves this by setting up a master [System_vpinball] section with a 
      search_path to all the "roms" (i.e. vpx and vpt files), but with a <vector_to> rule that
      points to a different configuration (System_vpinball9) to run the VP9 (*.vpt) files in.

Note: This example assumes an [Application] section for winipac exists.

Note: For reference, an commented (;) map_exit example is provided showing how we can also use WinClose
      to close the windows directly. 

Note: Because the [System_vpinball9] section's search_path is commented out, it is automatically 
      excluded from being displayed in the Quick-Switch game picker. This is what we want since the
      [System_vpinball] system's search_path includes all the roms (i.e. vpt & vpx files). 
      Consequently, all tables are displayed in one list (similar to what is done with Demul).

Note: Unless you use joysticks for tilt control, it is recommended that you disable joysticks in
      Visual Pinball's settings to avoid possible side-effects while in the arcadeEIP game selection
      menu.

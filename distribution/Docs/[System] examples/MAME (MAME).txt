Note: Commented lines are examples of optional variations. For example, the first search_path is one that supports
      the <change_root> rule (rule_1) for handling multiple parallel versions of MAME (see Rules Reference.pdf for more
      about that). The second search path is a simple direct path to the roms (*.zip files in this case).

Note: The <-video,1> parameter is an option to allow passthrough of the -video MAME parameter from the arcadeEIP 
      command-line if it is provided. For example, if you wanted to run a game in GDI video mode (perhaps to run it 
      over a remote desktop session), this parameter allows a command line like this to work:

      >eip galaga -video gdi   [runs Galaga in GDI video mode]

      See the Command-Line Reference.pdf for more information on passthrough params.

Note: This example assumes [Application] sections for ultramap and winipac exist.

Note: This example shows a meta_names link to the GameEx MAME.map file to get proper names of roms.

      If you want to update this to a newer version of MAME, follow the instructions outline in the readme.txt
      file found in \Assets\MAME\Meta\

      Keep in mind that if you integrate with LaunchBox or GameEx, you can synchronize with their MAME (or other system)
      game name lists without need for this names meta file.

Note: This example shows two optional paths to logos. These would override any settings in [Global_Assets]. To integrate
      with LaunchBox, specify the LaunchBox clear logo and marquee folders instead of the default locations.

Note: The clean_lists=1 option (which can also be set globally in the [Picker_Preferences] section, will remove
      text in parenthesis in the picks list view. For other options, see the Configuration Reference Guide.
      This setting is not applicable when integrating with LaunchBox.

Note: Test first, before uncommenting window_name for enhanced focus control.

Note: Versions of MAME prior to .172 will require use of alternate map_exit and map_pause settings due to lack of 
      support for the -keyboardprovider dinput parameter. Use {CloseActive} or {EndProc} to exit. You may also attempt 
      to use {PauseProc} to pause (by freezing the emulator process), but be aware that this can cause MAME to crash
      so test carefully before using.

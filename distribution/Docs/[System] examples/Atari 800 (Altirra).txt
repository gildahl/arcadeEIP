Note: Inside Altirra, set it to use windowed/borderless mode so that the menu
      will show through.  

Note: Altirra has an "experimental" DirectX 11 mode.  This seems to have a side effect in
      that sometimes after activating the game picker menu, performance of the emulator
      is reduced. Activating and releasing pause seems to fix it, but its probably best 
      just to stick with the default DirectX 9 mode, as this doesn't seem to exhibit the 
      problem.
      
Note: Adding the winset_A option on the exe_full_path line can be used to hide 
      window borders in fullscreen windowed mode. However, I have found that newer
      versions (v.4.0 for example) don't seem to need this anymore.  

Note: This example assumes [Application] sections for ultramap and winipac exist.

Note: window_name=process (or "Altirra/x64") is optional, but will provide more
      aggressive focus control.  As always, try without this setting first, and only after 
      all is working, try turning it on (window_name=process is preferred).

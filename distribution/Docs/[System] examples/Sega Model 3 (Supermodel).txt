Note: This example assumes [Application] sections for ultramap and winipac exist.

Note: * The use of "nohide" option is needed for Supermodel, otherwise window will not be visible.
      * The use of the "winset_B" option is recommended to eliminate the window title bar and 
	normalize the window position.
      * window_name= is optional, but recommended for more aggressive focus control. Try without it 
        first to ensure the emulator is working, then add the line as shown in the sample above.

Note: This configuration example requires you to create a text file for each game
      in your collection.  These are simply text (.txt) files whose name matches the rom
      and whose contents is the full command-line for that game.  These files act as rom proxies.

      To obtain a command line to place into the rom proxy file, run DaphneLoader and first 
      make sure the game is working properly via Daphne's configuration settings.  Once you have
      done so, press the Configure button and, in the Advanced Tab, enable "Display Command Line".
      The next time you run the game from DaphneLoader you will see the command line which you 
      can then copy into the proxy (text) file. 

      When saving to the proxy file, it is recommended that you edit the -x and -y values
      to be the resolution of your screen instead of the values set by Daphne. This will ensure 
      that arcadeEIP's overlay menu is displayed at the correct resolution.

      *** Be sure to fully exit DaphneLoader before testing in arcadeEIP ***

      As an example, to create a proxy file for Dragon's Lair (Enhancement v2.1), I created a file
      named lair.txt, placed it in my Daphne proxy file folder, "D:\Assets\Daphne\Proxies",
      and then copied/pasted this Daphne-generated commandline into the file (with x and y changed
      to my monitor's resolution):

      dle21 vldp -framefile D:/Emulators/Daphne/vldp_dl/lair/lair.txt -blank_searches 
      -min_seek_delay 1000 -seek_frames_per_ms 20 -homedir D:\Emulators\Daphne 
      -bank 0 11111000 -bank 1 00110111 -noissues -noserversend -sound_buffer 2048 
      -fullscreen -x 1600 -y 1200 

      (Note that your file may differ somewhat, and also note that the lair.txt file referenced
       in this command line example is not the rom proxy file noted above, but a "framefile" that
       Daphne generates which just happens to have the same name.)

      Once this is done, arcadeEIP will list and be capable of launching Dragon's Lair just
      like any other rom when running from either the game menu or at the command prompt such as:

        >eip.exe daphne lair

      Set up the rest of your games the same way.


Note: This example assumes [Application] sections for ultramap and joytokey exist.
      (the -joytokey entry runs the joytokey application upon exit using the 
       front-end's asset name).

Note: Test first, before uncommenting window_name for enhanced focus control.

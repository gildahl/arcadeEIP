Note: This example assumes [Application] sections for ultramap and winipac exist.

Note: To work properly in arcadeEIP, run Demul in windowed mode (not full screen). Set 
      Demul's video resolution to that of your monitor.

      * The use of "nohide" option is needed for Demul, otherwise the window will not be visible.
      * The use of the "winset_C" option is needed to center the window and remove the title bar and menu.
      * The use of the window_name parameter is *mandatory* in support of the winset_C option.

Note: Use of the latest (2018 or higher) version of Demul is strongly advised since earlier
      versions had issues using analog and digital controls in the same installation.

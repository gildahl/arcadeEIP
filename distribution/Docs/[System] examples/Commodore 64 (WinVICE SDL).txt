Note: The SDL2 version of WinVICE is used (version 3.6.1 tested here) instead of the GTK3 version 
      since fullscreen in the GTK3 version does not cooperate well with arcadeEIP's overlay menu. 
      The SDL version, however, works perfectly and also offers cleaner exit (no prompt), and the
      general advantage of being a purely command line driven application.

Note: Commented lines are examples of optional variations. Do not uncomment window_name= unless 
      the emulator is first tested to fully work. The folder options show a typical override paths 
      that might be used if integrating with LaunchBox.

Note: This example assumes [Application] sections for joytokey and winipac exist.

Note: Set the resolution parameters in the param_list to the resolution of your monitor. This is
      important to ensure arcadeEIP's overlay menu displays at the correct resolution. I set the
      -sdlaspectmode to 0 to stretch to the screen, but you could set to 2 for a more authentic 
      aspect ratio.

Note: It is beyond the scope of this tutorial on how to set up WinVICE; however, you will
      probably want to use the WinVICE SDL menu (accessed with F12) to setup your joystick, and 
      possibly sound (among other possible things).  I used a key mapped joystick along with 
      Joytokey to handle the joysticks.  Please read the WinVICE documentation for details.

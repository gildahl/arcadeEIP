[System_dosbox]
sys_key=dosbox
asset_name=Microsoft_DOS
proper_name=DOS
search_path=D:\Assets\Microsoft_DOS\Software\*.lnk
exe_full_path=D:\Assets\Microsoft_DOS\Software\[rom_name].lnk,nohide	
run_apps=ultramap,winipac,joytokey,-joytokey
map_pause={Blind}!{Pause}
map_exit=^{F9}


Note: This example assumes [Application] sections for ultramap and joytokey exist.
      (the -joytokey entry runs the joytokey application upon exit using the 
       front-end's asset name).

Note: The technique for supporting DOSBox in arcadeEIP is to first setup your
      games so that they can be launched successfully by a standard Windows
      shortcut. Then point the arcadeEIP.ini search_path at the folder containing 
      these links, and point the exe_full_path at the link (using the [rom_name]
      template).  arcadeEIP will now launch these links just as if they were
      any other emulated game.

      For example, to launch Novastorm (a great classic DOS arcade game BTW),
      configure dosbox.conf similar to this:

      [autoexec]
      # Lines in this section will be run at startup.
      mount c "D:\Assets\Microsoft_DOS\Software\Novastorm\Config"
      imgmount d d:\Assets\Microsoft_DOS\Software\Novastorm\cd\scaveng4.iso -t iso
      d:
      novastrm.exe
      exit

      Then create a â€ŒWindows shortcut in a dedicated folder somewhere (in this case
      in D:\Assets\Microsoft_DOS\Software\) with these settings:

      Target:   "C:\Program Files (x86)\DOSBox-0.74\DOSBox.exe" -noconsole
      Start in: D:\Assets\Microsoft_DOS\Software\Novastorm

LEDBlinky â€“ Arcade LED Control Software
=======================================
These instructions are a work-in-progress. Since I don't personally use LEDBlinky,
thanks to JaysArcade on the LaunchBox forums for testing some of this out.

LEDBlinky can be used with arcadeEIP by setting it up in stand-alone mode. This is
done by setting the front end (FE) in the Configure LEDBlinky tool to "Other Front-End".
It is likely that you will also need to turn on the "Use MAME to trigger the Game 
Start/Stop Events" option.

Minimally, the following command line functions in LEDBlinky can be supported:

* Game Start Event
  LEDBlinky.exe <rom> <emulator>

* FE Quit Event
  LEDBlinky.exe 2

These can be setup in arcadeEIP by first creating an [Application] section for
each one in arcadeEIP.ini

[Application_startledblinky]
app_key=startledblinky
proper_name=StartLEDBlinky
exe_full_path=C:\LEDBlinky\LEDBlinky.exe,nowait
param_list="[rom_file]" "[asset_name]"

[Application_quitledblinky]
app_key=quitledblinky
proper_name=QuitLEDBlinky
exe_full_path=C:\LEDBlinky\LEDBlinky.exe,nowait
param_list=2

These applications can then be called by editing the run_apps= lines as shown
in these examples:

[System_mame]
run_apps=startledblinky

[Front_End_os]
run_apps=quitledblinky

Additional LEDBlinky event commands should also be possible by adding additional
[Application] sections and adding these to run_apps and/or pause_apps as needed. 
If you find more options that work, let me know so I can add those to this 
documentation.

param_list="[profile]"


Note: Use of [asset_name]\[smart_name] pattern is documented in "Configuration Reference.pdf".
      When used, the software at runtime will replace [smart_name] with the rom_name and search for
      the profile having that name in a subfolder named for the name of the asset (for example,
      \WinIPAC\MAME\defender.cfg).  If file is not found, it will then try replacing [smart_name] 
      with the emulator or front-end’s asset_name (for example \WinIPAC\MAME\MAME.cfg).  
      If file is still not found, it will replace [smart_name] with the string “default” and look 
      for it in the parent folder (i.e. in this case, the \WinIPAC\default.cfg).

      The benefit of this pattern is that if a specific configuration file for the game doesn't
      exist, it will automatically use the default one for the system, but if it is found, it will
      be automatically used. This permits one to create profiles and drop them in the folder 
      at any time, without having to change the configuration.

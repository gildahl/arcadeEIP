Update Log
========================================

0.3.3.3 Small feature update
* Added discrete quit_key= option to [Key Map]. Same as exit_key except it is
  independent of the magic_key function. Use this if you want to be able to exit
  using, say, a magic_key on your control panel and an independent hotkey, such
  as on a Stream Deck.

0.3.3.2 Small feature and bug fix update
* Added new sort_prefix= option to system and custom list sections. This can be
  used to override the sort order of systems and custom lists in the menu. 
* Fixed state bug that could cause deletion of the wrong item in custom lists.

0.3.3.1 Hotfix
* Fixed the discrete menu toggle keys to show "=" and hide "-" the menu. 

0.3.3.0 Major Update
* IMPORTANT: A clean install is required with this new version due to new features
  and substantial changes to many configuration items. 

* Added sound effects for various menu actions. Note that this feature requires
  the third-party library bass.dll (see sound.txt in root folder for more info). 
  This is library is free for non-commercial use. 

* Additional metadata is now displayed when available, including genre, year, 
  publisher, developer, and number of players. Most of this information
  is obtained through arcadeEIP's improved integration with LaunchBox (see "Quick
  Start 1 - MAME.txt", step 6b, and LaunchBox.txt in "\Docs\[Front_End] examples").

* Favorites and star Ratings have been added as native game-specific attributes. With
  the ability to use these properties and other metadata properties to create custom 
  pick lists. The following list management hot keys have been added in support of
  this (default key assignments provided here):

  Game Marking:
  =============
  * M   : [M]arks/unmarks a game as a favorite (adds/removes heart icon)
  * S   : Sets a game's [s]tar rating from 0 to 5 stars

  List Management:
  ================
  * a   : Copy or remove all games in list
  * f   : Copy or remove all games with same [f]avorite marking as the selected game
  * r   : Copy or remove all games with same star [r]ating as the selected game
  * g   : Copy or remove all games with same [g]enre as the selected game
  * u   : Copy or remove all games with same p[u]blisher as the selected game
  * d   : Copy or remove all games with same [d]eveloper as the selected game
  * y   : Copy or remove all games with same [y]year as the selected game
  * n   : Copy or remove all games with same [n]umber of players as the selected game

* Added support for a file called omit.txt in the \hi2txt folder that may be used to 
  list any roms to be excluded from hi2txt processing (for example, if a particular 
  game is getting corrupted by hi2txt processing). See Configuration Reference Guide.pdf
  for more information.

* Changed the default for mouse/trackball/spinner support (mouse_vert and mouse_horiz) 
  to "off" by default to avoid problems with initial experience under certain hardware
  configurations. Set these to "all" to turn mouse support on, and report any problems if
  found.

* Added visual gradients to game picker menu screen backgrounds.
* Initialization progress bar now provides descriptive loading information.
* Made exiting while still initializing much more responsive.
* Added a C64 template (WinVICE) example to [System] examples.
* Many other documentation updates and small bug fixes.

0.3.2.1
* Added hotstring_prefix setting to [General] section of arcade.ini
* Now require an ENTER command after a hotstring.
* Added:
 
    select_show_key==
    select_hide_key=- 
    select_toggle_key=' (updated: was /)

  hot keys to the [Key_Map] section of arcade.ini to provide discrete
  menu control independent of the "magic" key over menu display.
* Added mark_picks (was mark_favorites) setting to [Picker_Preferences] 
  section of arcadeEIP.ini to alter whether to show a star when a list is
  in its favorites (picks) mode or in its master mode.
* Fixed a long-standing state issue when switching games externally while
  the game select list is displayed.
* Re-coded the "previous game" function to go to the last game actually
  played rather than the previous game in the auto-switch list.
* Made "q" and "w" keys the now recommended key mappings for previous_key
  and next_key due for compatibility reasons with Stella. "[" and "]" 
  remain mapped, but may be removed from the default mapping in the 
  future. 
* Display a "Please Wait..." message if next_key is pressed before 
  startup initialization is complete.
* Updated documentation. In particular, regarding use of direct-switch
  hotstring files and Stream Deck use case documentation.

0.3.2.0
* show_on_pause feature now supports multiple image types,  
  including the ability to add custom types. See the show_on_pause=
  option in the Configuration Reference Guide for details.
* Also added support to display game info extracted from history.xml 
  and/or mameinfo.data on pause if those files are available. See both 
  the show_on_pause= and mameinfo_folder= setting in the Configuration 
  Reference Guide for details.
* Direct switching now supports hotstrings in addition to hotkeys. See
  the readme.txt file in the \Direct folder. This is to make it easier
  to configure appliance front-ends like the Stream Deck for large game
  lists (see StreamDeck.txt in the \Docs\[Front_End] examples folder).
* Now allow the kiosk_mode and magic_delay settings to be overridden
  in the [Front_End] sections if desired. For example, kiosk_mode=1
  tends to make more sense in standalone, whereas kiosk_mode=0
  tends to make more sense when launched from conventional front ends.
  So if you use arcadeEIP both ways, you can configure for both.
* Fixed pause button state issues that were causing side effects.
* Will no longer buffer next/previous game key presses while paused
  or in the game select screen.
* Fixed a small bug in attract list initialization. 
* Fixed an issue with taskbar hiding/unhiding.
* Fixed a fairly major bug causing the game selection list to scroll 
  incorrectly when set to certain font sizes.
* The game selection menu now auto-computes the proper number of rows to
  be displayed. Consequently, removed top_rows= and bottom_rows= from 
  [Picker_Preference] since these are no longer needed as user settings.
* Increased the default font size in the game selection menu from 10
  to 14 for better default visibility (user can still change this).
* Icon color for Favorites and Add/Remove in selection menu is now 
  yellow to match the color of the Master Favorites list.
* New bookend screen and marquee alpha-fade effect when switching games.
  See alpha_effect= setting in the Configuration Reference Guide.
* Some additional minor bug fixes, and updates to documentation.

0.3.1.2
* Added support for the display of control panel map image files (or
  other specified image type) when pause is activated.
* \Resources folder was missing from install resulting in missing icons
  in the quick pick menu.
* [smart_name] profile template now searches subfolders, providing
  option to organize profiles in subfolders with no added configuration.
* Some minor bug fixes, and updates to documentation.

0.3.1.1
* Added stage to high score text (if available)
* Improved BigBox asset search (some image files could be missed).
* Some documentation errors were corrected.

0.3.1.0
* arcadeEIP now supports BigBox integration, including use of
  its managed image assets. Tips for integrating with BigBox have been
  added to the \[Front_End] examples folder, and configuration document.
* The default was changed such that a short press of the magic key (the
  period (.) by default) exits, and a long press (2 sec) invokes the
  quick-pick game menu. Change kiosk_mode to 1 to invert this.
* Structure of the \Assets folder has been refactored. Please ensure
  that if you use these folders, that your paths may need to change.
  See readme.txt in the \Assets folder for specific infomation.
* winset_* routines were improved significantly in support of
  Demul (Naomi), Altirra (Atari 8-bit) and Supermodel (Sega Model 3).
  See updates to these systems in the "\[System] examples" folder.
* Made fuzzy rom search case insensitive, along with other improvements.
* Fixed sizing issue with large logos on bookend screens. Also, games 
  without logos will now display the name of the game.
* The nohide option now removes/restores the windows task bar.
* The -findall command line option now supports multi-word search terms,
  and no longer returns duplicate entries.
* Previous high score didn't always clear from the marquee.
* Prevented multiple instances from running (issue in BigBox).
* Fixed some bugs in the Quick menu.
* Fixed formatting of high scores without names/initials.
* Created "MAME Quick Start.txt" and "MARQUEE Quick Start.txt"
  tutorial files. Also many other documentation updates and improvements.

* Added support for hi2txt (game high score displays in marquee)

0.3.0.1 
* Added support for dynamic marquees
* Changed doc format to pdf
* Removed separate system_logo setting from [Global_Assets]

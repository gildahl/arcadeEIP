Update Log
========================================

0.4.1.1 (pending release)
* Added support for half-star ratings.
* Provided an independent fade_effect setting in the [Marquee] section of 
  arcadeEIP.ini. When set to 1, a the normal fade effect will be used when
  changing marquees. When set to 0, the change will be instant. Setting to 0
  will use new new poll_frequency and wait_frequency settings, which permit
  much faster marquee switching when using marquee_manager.exe. These are 
  further documented in the Configuration Reference Guide.pdf.

0.4.1.0 Major feature and bug fix release 
Note that this version contains fairly major changes including changes to default
key assignments and new arcadeEIP.ini keys. It is therefore highly recommended that
you do a full reinstall of arcadeEIP to ensure full synchronization with the new
feature set.

* A major change was made to drastically improve the ease of configuration,
  compatibility, and intuitiveness of launching and switching games using button
  panels such as the Elgato StreamDeck. Use of hot strings and macros to do this is
  no longer needed as games can now be both launched AND switched using the standard
  command line "eip.exe <sys_key> <rom>" (for example, "eip.exe mame galaga.zip").
  See StreamDeck.txt in the Docs\[Front_End] examples folder for more information.  
* Added the ability to manually save high scores and take a snapshot for any game in any
  system. See readme.txt file in the ..\Assets folder. This makes it possible for the
  dynamic marquee to show high scores for any game and have these persist independendent
  of vram state. Use RIGHT Ctrl-Alt-D to snap a picture and enter your high score.
  The screenshot will be stored in the ..\Assets/<system>\HighScore\Rom folder. Turn 
  the feature on/off using the highscore_screenshots key in arcadeEIP.ini.
* Added a new executable called marquee_manager.exe. This is not used by arcadeEIP
  but allows the dynamic marquee feature to be used by external programs such as batch
  files or other front ends via through a command line interface. See the "Using Marquee
  Manager.txt" file for complete instructions. (thanks MKChamp for the suggestion)
* Marquee scorecard text could contain garbage characters due to being left in their
  native encoding format. This has been fixed by implementing Unicode translation.
* Async communications between arcadeEIP and the marquee switcher has been overhauled
  to use a (cleaner) COM interface method rather than a pseudo pipe file method.
* Fixed some regressions in the run_apps= setting inside the [Picker_Preferences] 
  setting and added a new whitelist= setting to accompany it. Whitelisting games
  will cause apps to run ONLY if one of the white-listed games is running. For
  example, if you are running a game like Q*Bert, its diagonal-only profile, could 
  cause issues in the menu. Using this new capability, you can now have the menu
  update the joystick to use a normal 4-way profile in the menu only when Q*Bert 
  (and/or other games that need it) is running, rather than for all games. For more
  information, search Configuration Reference Guide.pdf for the text, "whitelist".
* Fixed a regression that caused an assertion error when trying to launch a rom
  without specifying a sys_key. This is legal to do but broke after the code update
  to AHK 2.  This is now fixed.
* Fixed another AHK 2 related regression that would cause a crash if attempting
  to use the next_key function before the game list was fully loaded. Also used this
  opportunity to improve user messages related to next_key/previous_key game switching.
* Fixed another AHK 2 related regression that could cause a crash while processing
  the <remove_param> rule.
* Fixed another AHK 2 related regression that could cause a crash if bass.dll was missing.
* Addressed an issue where if arcadeEIP lost an emulator's process id (due to it being
  reset or closed, etc.) it could exhibit odd behavior, such as an empty game menu.
  This is now better detected and will provide a message to the user, then close 
  (hopefully) gracefully. 
* For those using a second audio card to support sound in arcadeEIP when using MAME
  port audio, it was (annoyingly) probable that sound could stop working if Windows 
  re-indexed your audio devices. For this reason, the sound_device= setting now uses
  the name of the audio device rather than its index.  See sound.txt for more info. 
* Added support for paging through game lists by alphanumeric leading character.
  This should help in navigating through very long game lists much more quickly.
  By default, pressing z moves up and x moves down by letter/number. These keys 
  can be changed via new settings in the [Key_Map] section of arcadeEIP.ini called
  lcup= and lcdn=
* Focus could be lost when returning to Big Box under certain conditions (for
  example, this was found to happen when using the hi2txt feature). To address this,
  a new window_name= setting was added to the Front End sections of arcadeEIP.ini 
  to permit configuration of more aggressive focus re-acquisition. In the case of 
  Big Box, if you are having this issue, add "window_name=LaunchBox Big Box" to 
  the [Front_End_bigbox] section.
* A crash bug could be encountered when setting show_license=0 in the [General]
  section of arcadeEIP.ini.  This has been fixed.
* Exiting arcadeEIP before full initialization could result in the game menu's last
  saved state being reset. This has been fixed. 
* ...Additionally, reading the last saved state could cause a crash if system or game
  information had changed between sessions (such as by hiding systems, adding/removing
  systems, adding/removing roms, etc.). A full overhaul was made to the state-reading
  code, which should fix those issues. 
* ...Additionally, the menu's saved state now stores the last selected menu. If you
  would like the default menu on startup to be the last selected one, just clear the
  value of default_list= in [Picker_Preferences], making it empty.
* Removed support for omit.txt file, which was a hack used to skip specific games
  from hi2txt processing. This is because the nvram corruption issue it was meant to 
  address (and didn't) should rather be done by removing the game's xml files 
  from hi2txt itself (i.e. since such corruption is a hi2txt issue, not an arcadeEIP
  issue).
* Fixed an issue in which unpausing while mameinfo text was displayed would result in
  that text being re-displayed when locking/unlocking a game. Also corrected the 
  arcadeEIP.ini entry for lock-game, which was being created as lock_game= rather than
  lock_game_key=  
* Changed "picks" star icon from yellow to white for aesthetic reasons.
* The default key assignment for the "panic_key" was changed from ctrl-alt-k (^!k) to 
  explicitly use the right ctrl and alt keys (>^>!k) since use of the left keys could
  conflict with key assignments (and so not work) in the game selection menu.  
* The default key assignments for list_mode_key, add_remove_key, and edit_mode_key have
  been changed to i, j, and k respectively. This is a refinement to address issues with
  the previous assignments (Alt, Space, & Shift) that made it too easy for users to 
  accidentally edit (due to double-mapping with common MAME keys), among other issues.
* Added deeper validation checking of arcadeEIP.ini. Now detects sys_key duplication
  and certain section name errors that are easy to miss.
* Miscellaneous bug fixes including several unhandled exceptions in edge cases that
  could cause crashes.
* Miscellaneous graphic refinements, especially in alpha fading effects.
* Associated updates to documentation, including a thorough review of the Configuration
  and Command-Line guides to correct errors and add missing items.

0.4.0.2 Feature and documentation update: 
* Volume normalization. Added a new feature which provides the ability to 
  specify sound volume adjustments for individual roms. See end of readme.txt in  
  ..\Assets folder for more information about how to use volume.ini to do this.
* Attract mode timer pause. Added a new feature that will temporarily
  pause automatic game switching to lock your arcade machine to the currently 
  active game by using the hotkey ctrl-alt-l, or by holding the pause key down
  for several seconds. The latter method is disabled by default, but may be turned
  on by setting the pause_lock= setting in arcadeEIP.ini.  See Configuration Reference 
  Guide.pdf for more information.
* Kiosk Mode is now turned on by default. This better reflects how arcadeEIP
  is intended to work stand-alone (i.e. a short press of the period key
  will toggle the menu and a long press exits). You may reverse this behavior by 
  setting kiosk_mode=0, which may be preferred if you are using arcadeEIP as a
  launcher from another Front End.
* Corrected documentation to clarify the use of util.exe to run the -sound 
  option (instead of eip.exe).
* Removed non-game records from default .meta file for MAME to better declutter
  the default MAME game list.
* Added preliminary instructions for integrating LEDBlinky with arcadeEIP to
  ..\Docs\[Application]\LEDBlinky.txt (thanks to JaysArcade)
* Added new pause_apps= setting to [System] sections of arcadeEIP.ini to permit 
  triggering applications to run upon pause/unpause. See Configuration Reference
  Guide.pdf for more information.
* Removed feature that automatically enabled/disabled Windows taskbar autohide
  setting. Replaced this with a new hide_taskbar= option in [Front_End] sections of
  arcadeEIP.ini. See Configuration Reference Guide.pdf for more information. 
* Fixed bug preventing run once apps specified with a "+" in the run_apps setting
  of [Front_End_os] from running.

0.4.0.1 Hot-fix: added missing favorites/star rating icons to 
..\Resource\Icons folder.

0.4.0.0 Port to AHK 2.0, code refactor, public source code release.
* Ported arcadeEIP from AHK 1.1 to 2.0, while also performing some major
  refactoring, regression testing, and bug fixing. Should remain compatible
  with prior versions, so hopefully this should work as a drop in replacement
  update, not requiring a full re-install for those with previous versions.
* Moved source code to GitHub (https://github.com/gildahl/arcadeEIP) and 
  made publicly available (see license.txt for terms). This will also serve
  as the release point for all new releases.
* It should now be possible for the exe_full_path and search_path settings to
  use paths that contain commas.
* The delimiter between separate search_paths has been changed from a single
  pipe character to a double pipe ("||").
* While eip.exe remains the primary executable, console commands having text
  output have been moved to a new executable (util.exe). These include -sound,
  -createproxy, -systems, -find, -list, etc.  See the "Command Line Reference 
  Guide.pdf" for more information.
* Removed "change_root" rule from default MAME configuration. To use this
  feature, refer to the Rules Reference Guide.

0.3.3.3 Small feature update
* Added discrete quit_key= option to [Key Map]. Same as exit_key except it is
  independent of the magic_key function. Use this if you want to be able to exit
  using, say, a magic_key on your control panel and an independent hotkey, such
  as on a Stream Deck.

0.3.3.2 Small feature and bug fix update
* Added new sort_prefix= option to system and custom list sections. This can be
  used to override the sort order of systems and custom lists in the menu. 
* Fixed state bug that could cause deletion of the wrong item in custom lists.

0.3.3.1 Hotfix
* Fixed the discrete menu toggle keys to show "=" and hide "-" the menu. 

0.3.3.0 Major Update
* IMPORTANT: A clean install is required with this new version due to new features
  and substantial changes to many configuration items. 

* Added sound effects for various menu actions. Note that this feature requires
  the third-party library bass.dll (see sound.txt in root folder for more info). 
  This is library is free for non-commercial use. 

* Additional metadata is now displayed when available, including genre, year, 
  publisher, developer, and number of players. Most of this information
  is obtained through arcadeEIP's improved integration with LaunchBox (see "Quick
  Start 1 - MAME.txt", step 6b, and LaunchBox.txt in "\Docs\[Front_End] examples").

* Favorites and star Ratings have been added as native game-specific attributes. With
  the ability to use these properties and other metadata properties to create custom 
  pick lists. The following list management hot keys have been added in support of
  this (default key assignments provided here):

  Game Marking:
  =============
  * M   : [M]arks/unmarks a game as a favorite (adds/removes heart icon)
  * S   : Sets a game's [s]tar rating from 0 to 5 stars

  List Management:
  ================
  * a   : Copy or remove all games in list
  * f   : Copy or remove all games with same [f]avorite marking as the selected game
  * r   : Copy or remove all games with same star [r]ating as the selected game
  * g   : Copy or remove all games with same [g]enre as the selected game
  * u   : Copy or remove all games with same p[u]blisher as the selected game
  * d   : Copy or remove all games with same [d]eveloper as the selected game
  * y   : Copy or remove all games with same [y]year as the selected game
  * n   : Copy or remove all games with same [n]umber of players as the selected game

* Added support for a file called omit.txt in the \hi2txt folder that may be used to 
  list any roms to be excluded from hi2txt processing (for example, if a particular 
  game is getting corrupted by hi2txt processing). See Configuration Reference Guide.pdf
  for more information.

* Changed the default for mouse/trackball/spinner support (mouse_vert and mouse_horiz) 
  to "off" by default to avoid problems with initial experience under certain hardware
  configurations. Set these to "all" to turn mouse support on, and report any problems if
  found.

* Added visual gradients to game picker menu screen backgrounds.
* Initialization progress bar now provides descriptive loading information.
* Made exiting while still initializing much more responsive.
* Added a C64 template (WinVICE) example to [System] examples.
* Many other documentation updates and small bug fixes.

0.3.2.1
* Added hotstring_prefix setting to [General] section of arcade.ini
* Now require an ENTER command after a hotstring.
* Added:
 
    select_show_key==
    select_hide_key=- 
    select_toggle_key=' (updated: was /)

  hot keys to the [Key_Map] section of arcade.ini to provide discrete
  menu control independent of the "magic" key over menu display.
* Added mark_picks (was mark_favorites) setting to [Picker_Preferences] 
  section of arcadeEIP.ini to alter whether to show a star when a list is
  in its favorites (picks) mode or in its master mode.
* Fixed a long-standing state issue when switching games externally while
  the game select list is displayed.
* Re-coded the "previous game" function to go to the last game actually
  played rather than the previous game in the auto-switch list.
* Made "q" and "w" keys the now recommended key mappings for previous_key
  and next_key due for compatibility reasons with Stella. "[" and "]" 
  remain mapped, but may be removed from the default mapping in the 
  future. 
* Display a "Please Wait..." message if next_key is pressed before 
  startup initialization is complete.
* Updated documentation. In particular, regarding use of direct-switch
  hotstring files and Stream Deck use case documentation.

0.3.2.0
* show_on_pause feature now supports multiple image types,  
  including the ability to add custom types. See the show_on_pause=
  option in the Configuration Reference Guide for details.
* Also added support to display game info extracted from history.xml 
  and/or mameinfo.data on pause if those files are available. See both 
  the show_on_pause= and mameinfo_folder= setting in the Configuration 
  Reference Guide for details.
* Direct switching now supports hotstrings in addition to hotkeys. See
  the readme.txt file in the \Direct folder. This is to make it easier
  to configure appliance front-ends like the Stream Deck for large game
  lists (see StreamDeck.txt in the \Docs\[Front_End] examples folder).
* Now allow the kiosk_mode and magic_delay settings to be overridden
  in the [Front_End] sections if desired. For example, kiosk_mode=1
  tends to make more sense in standalone, whereas kiosk_mode=0
  tends to make more sense when launched from conventional front ends.
  So if you use arcadeEIP both ways, you can configure for both.
* Fixed pause button state issues that were causing side effects.
* Will no longer buffer next/previous game key presses while paused
  or in the game select screen.
* Fixed a small bug in attract list initialization. 
* Fixed an issue with taskbar hiding/unhiding.
* Fixed a fairly major bug causing the game selection list to scroll 
  incorrectly when set to certain font sizes.
* The game selection menu now auto-computes the proper number of rows to
  be displayed. Consequently, removed top_rows= and bottom_rows= from 
  [Picker_Preference] since these are no longer needed as user settings.
* Increased the default font size in the game selection menu from 10
  to 14 for better default visibility (user can still change this).
* Icon color for Favorites and Add/Remove in selection menu is now 
  yellow to match the color of the Master Favorites list.
* New bookend screen and marquee alpha-fade effect when switching games.
  See alpha_effect= setting in the Configuration Reference Guide.
* Some additional minor bug fixes, and updates to documentation.

0.3.1.2
* Added support for the display of control panel map image files (or
  other specified image type) when pause is activated.
* \Resources folder was missing from install resulting in missing icons
  in the quick pick menu.
* [smart_name] profile template now searches subfolders, providing
  option to organize profiles in subfolders with no added configuration.
* Some minor bug fixes, and updates to documentation.

0.3.1.1
* Added stage to high score text (if available)
* Improved BigBox asset search (some image files could be missed).
* Some documentation errors were corrected.

0.3.1.0
* arcadeEIP now supports BigBox integration, including use of
  its managed image assets. Tips for integrating with BigBox have been
  added to the \[Front_End] examples folder, and configuration document.
* The default was changed such that a short press of the magic key (the
  period (.) by default) exits, and a long press (2 sec) invokes the
  quick-pick game menu. Change kiosk_mode to 1 to invert this.
* Structure of the \Assets folder has been refactored. Please ensure
  that if you use these folders, that your paths may need to change.
  See readme.txt in the \Assets folder for specific infomation.
* winset_* routines were improved significantly in support of
  Demul (Naomi), Altirra (Atari 8-bit) and Supermodel (Sega Model 3).
  See updates to these systems in the "\[System] examples" folder.
* Made fuzzy rom search case insensitive, along with other improvements.
* Fixed sizing issue with large logos on bookend screens. Also, games 
  without logos will now display the name of the game.
* The nohide option now removes/restores the windows task bar.
* The -findall command line option now supports multi-word search terms,
  and no longer returns duplicate entries.
* Previous high score didn't always clear from the marquee.
* Prevented multiple instances from running (issue in BigBox).
* Fixed some bugs in the Quick menu.
* Fixed formatting of high scores without names/initials.
* Created "MAME Quick Start.txt" and "MARQUEE Quick Start.txt"
  tutorial files. Also many other documentation updates and improvements.

0.3.0.2
* Added support for hi2txt (game high score displays in marquee)

0.3.0.1 
* Added support for dynamic marquees
* Changed doc format to pdf
* Removed separate system_logo setting from [Global_Assets]
  (Use a file called <asset_name>.png in logo_folder instead.)

0.3.0  
* Initial public release

Marquee quick start guide
=========================

Use this quick start after the MAME Quick Start.

*** Use Ctrl-Alt-x to exit marquee.exe at any time ***

If you have a marquee monitor...

1. Copy a set of marquee files (named after your roms) into 
   ..\Assets\MAME\Marquees
   (or set marquee_folder= in [Global_Assets] to where they are)
   If you use LaunchBox, you may already have this setup if you followed
   step 7b in the MAME Quick Start guide.

2. In the [Marquee] section of arcadeEIP.ini, set active=1. The monitor= line
   should normally be set to 2, but might need a different number if you have
   more than 2 monitors.

3. Double-click on marquee.exe, and ensure the prompts appear on your marquee
   monitor (if not, change monitor= to another number).

4. Run eip.exe with a game. The marquee should appear on the marquee monitor.


High score support...
=====================
You may display high score information on the marquee that comes from arcadeEIP's 
own built-in Scorecard dialog (accessed using the ';' key), or from MAME's high
score plug-in feature, or from both.

A. Showing high scores on the marquee using arcadeEIP's Scorecard dialog is turned on
   by default. So as long as show_high_scores is set to 1 in the [Marquee] section of
   arcadeEIP.ini (the default), this should work automatically. Note that high scores
   recorded this way will override any high scores from the MAME plug-in/hi2txt.

B. Showing high scores from the MAME plug-in requires the installation of a utility 
   called hi2txt. To install and use this, follow these instructions:

   1. Make sure the hiscore plugin for MAME is active and working (you should be generating
      *.hi files in your mame \hi or \hiscore folders).  See this web page for instructions.

      https://docs.mamedev.org/plugins/hiscore.html

   2. Obtain the C# hi2txt 7z archive from https://greatstoneex.github.io/hi2txt-doc/
      and unpack it to a subfolder of arcadeEIP called \hi2txt.

   3. In the [System_mame] section of arcadeEIP, set: use_hi2txt=1

   From this point on, any game having a compatible *.hi file in mame's \hi or \hiscore
   folder will display the high score at the bottom of the marquee. 

   Important: Note that hi2txt is hit-or-miss on what games it works with. If you encounter
   problems with certain games it is far more likely that it is an issue with hi2txt than a
   problem with arcadeEIP. For example, it is not unheard of for high score support to corrupt 
   a MAME nvram file. If this happens, just delete the nvram file, and also consider deleting 
   the xml file supporting that game from the hi2txt game library zip file. 

   In general, however, if a game does not support hi2txt, including all non-MAME games, you
   can always use arcadeEIP's Scorecard dialog instead.

marquee_manager.exe
===================
Marquee Manager is a simple .exe utility that can be used to display marquees using a
command-line. This utility is not used by arcadeEIP, but is available for 3rd party applications 
to use. For a list of supported parameters, just run the application with no arguments and
you will be provided with instructions.
